<h3 align="center">This repository is a php exercise carried out during Becode training   </h3> <br>

<h2> Overview</h2> 

>TraddingApp is a Laravel-based API for a trading simulation application. The API allows users to manage their profiles, open and close trades, and perform various trading-related actions.

The url of the API will be for example: http://localhost:8000/

<h2 align="left">üì¶ Prerequisites</h2> 

>Before getting started with this project, you'll need the following installed on your system:

- PHP (>= 7.4)
- Composer (Dependency Manager for PHP)
- MySql or other server sql
- Web Server (e.g., Apache, Nginx)

>Make sure you have these dependencies installed and properly configured on your machine before proceeding with the installation.

<h2 align="left">üöÄ Installation</h2>

* Clone the Repository
  ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Blog_Api.git
  ```
  
 * Navigate to the project directory:
	```sh
	  cd tradding-app
	```

* Create a database and update the .env file with your database credentials.
	```
	  cp .env.example .env
	```

* Install Composer dependencies using composer install.
	```
		composer install
	```

* Generate a new application key by running php artisan key:generate.
	```
		php artisan key:generate
	```

* Run Laravel migrations to set up the required database tables using php artisan migrate.
	```
		php artisan migrate
	```

* Optionally, seed the database with initial data:
	```
		php artisan db:seed
	```

<h2>JWT Authentication  </h2>

>To implement an authentication system using JWT (JSON Web Tokens), you can follow these steps:

* Install the required package:
	```
	composer require tymon/jwt-auth
	```
* Publish the package configuration file:
	```
	php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Tymon\JWTAuth\Providers\LaravelServiceProvider"
	```
* Generate a secret key for JWT:
	```
	php artisan jwt:secret
	```
* Update the .env file to configure JWT:
	```
	Update the .env file to configure JWT:
	```
* Create a new controller for handling authentication:
	```
	php artisan make:controller AuthController
	```
In this controller, implement methods for registration, login, logout, etc., using JWT for token-based authentication.

* Define routes for authentication in the routes/api.php file.

* Laravel already includes its routing system, so there's no need to install a separate router package.
* Use Thunder Client (VSCode extension), cURL or Postman to test the API endpoints and verify responses.
